# Daycare Face and Action Recognition System

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing an intelligent system for daycare settings that recognizes both faces and actions of children. The system leverages cutting-edge deep learning models to ensure high accuracy in real-time recognition tasks.

### Key Achievements:
- **98% Accuracy in Daycare Face Recognition**: Developed a high-accuracy Transformer model for daycare face recognition using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) facial embeddings. This model is capable of accurately recognizing children's faces in a daycare environment.
  
- **97% Accuracy in Daycare Action Recognition**: Implemented a BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) model for action recognition, using MoveNet pose embeddings to detect and recognize actions performed by children in daycare. The action recognition system can effectively classify different actions like playing, running, or sitting based on pose data.

- **Korean Children Face and Action Recognition Dataset**: Constructed a custom dataset specifically focused on face and action recognition for children in daycare settings. This dataset includes labeled images and videos of children performing various actions and provides a robust foundation for training and evaluating the models.

## Project Highlights
- **Daycare Face Recognition**: By utilizing MTCNN facial embeddings and a Transformer-based architecture, the face recognition model achieves **98% accuracy**, offering a reliable solution for identifying children in daycare settings.
  
- **Daycare Action Recognition**: Using MoveNet's pose embeddings with a BiLSTM model, the action recognition system demonstrates **97% accuracy** in recognizing different actions, making it an effective tool for monitoring activities and ensuring child safety.

- **Dataset Creation**: The Korean children face and action recognition dataset includes diverse and challenging examples of children in daycare environments, making it ideal for training robust models in a real-world context.
